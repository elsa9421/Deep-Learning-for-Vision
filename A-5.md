## 1. Single Stage Object Detection - YOLO (PyTorch)
Based on YOLO (v1 - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf and v2 - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf)
Implemented a single-stage object detector and used it to train a model that can detect objects on novel images.

### Dataset:
PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset which has been annotated with bounding boxes where each box gives the category label and spatial extent of some object in the image.
Training images : a subsample of 2500 images are selected for training ( to reduce computational load). 

### Architecture:
Backbone Network: The MobileNet v2 (https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_mobilenet_v2/) is used for image feature extraction.After passing the input image through this backbone network we get a convolutional feature map. 
Prediction Network:  inputs the features from the backbone network, and outputs the classification scores and transformations for each anchor. This conists of two 1x1 conv layers which together formed a receptive field of 3x3 and is used as a sliding window over the feature map obtained from the Backbone network.
Used Non-Maximum Supression to discard overlapping bounding boxes.


### Evaluation:
Calculated the detection accuracy using the classic metric mean Average Precision(mAP - https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP). Achieved around 11.6% mAP

## 2. Two- stage Object Detector (PyTorch)
Implemented two stage object detector based on Faster R-CNN. The main difference between the two being that single-stage detectors perform region proposal and classification simultaneously while two-stage detectors have them decoupled.

### Dataset: 
Same as Single Stage Detector

### Architecture:
Region Proposal Network(RPN): The RPN classifies a set of anchors as either containing an object or not, and also regresses from the position of the anchor box to a region proposal. It does not predict the classification scores as in Single stage Network. 

### Evaluation:
Calculated the detection accuracy using the classic metric mean Average Precision(mAP - https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP). Achieved around 16% mAP

Other Details:
Implemented in PyTorch on Google Colab, utilised Colab GPU.
