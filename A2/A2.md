## linear_classifier.ipynb and linear_classifer.py

Two linear classifiers SVM and Softmax Classifiers are used.

### SVM Classifier:
Tuned hyperparameters (regularization strength and learning rate) to get -
best validation accuracy achieved during cross-validation: 39.170000
final test set accuracy: 39.2400

### Softmax Classifier

best validation accuracy achieved during cross-validation: 38.060000
final test set accuracy: 38.6



## two_layer_net.ipynb and two_layer_net.py

In this notebook a neural network with fully-connected layers is used to perform to perform image classification, and is tested out on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The network is trained with a softmax loss function and L2 regularization on the weight matrices. 
The network uses a ReLU nonlinearity after the first fully connected layer.

Architecture:
input - fully connected layer - ReLU - fully connected layer - softmax
The outputs of the second fully-connected layer are the scores for each class.

Accuracy :
54.12%
