## pytorch101.py and pytorch101.ipynb
These notebooks explore basics of pytorch


## knn.py and knn.ipynb
This notebook implements a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
After which, cross-validation is used to find the best value of K.

The goals of this exercise are to go through a simple example of the data-driven image classification pipeline,
and also to practice writing efficient, vectorized code in PyTorch.
