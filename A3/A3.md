## fully_connected_networks.ipynb and fully_connected_networks.py

Implemented  fully-connected networks using modular approach. 
For each layer we will implement a forward and a backward function. 
The forward function will receive inputs, weights, and other parameters,
and will return both an output and a cache object storing data needed for the backward pass.
After implementing a bunch of layers this way, we will be able to easily combine them to build classifiers with different architectures.
